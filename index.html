            <p>JavaScript and Java are both widely used programming languages, albeit serving different purposes and having distinct syntax and characteristics. This documentation aims to provide an overview of both languages, covering their fundamental aspects such as variables, data types, function declarations, and more.</p>
            <p>JavaScript, often used for front-end web development, enables dynamic and interactive content on web pages. On the other hand, Java, known for its platform independence, is extensively used in backend development, mobile applications, and enterprise-level systems.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Client-side JavaScript refers to JavaScript code that is executed in a user's web browser. Client-side JavaScript is primarily used to enhance user interactivity and experience on web pages.</li>
                <li>Server-side JavaScript refers to JavaScript code executed on the server rather than in the user's browser. It handles backend operations like database interactions, file system manipulation, authentication, and business logic.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>Both JavaScript and Java serve unique purposes in the realm of software development. While JavaScript focuses on enhancing web interactivity, Java provides a robust foundation for diverse applications. Having a grasp of their individual strengths allows developers to choose the appropriate language for specific project requirements.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Understanding of web development principles, such as client-server architecture, HTTP/HTTPS, URLs, and how web applications function.</li>
                <li>Basic knowledge and understanding of HTML, including tags, elements, attributes, and the structure of web pages.</li>
            </ul>

            <header>JavaScript and Java</header>
            <p>JavaScript and Java, despite sharing a similar name, are fundamentally different languages.</p>
            <p>JavaScript, a scripting language primarily used for client-side web development, allows for the creation of dynamic and interactive web content.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, Java, a strongly typed, object-oriented language, is used for building scalable applications, ranging from mobile apps to enterprise-level software.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="variables">
            <header>Variables</header>
            <p>Variables in JavaScript and Java serve as containers for storing data values. JavaScript and Java handle variables differently in terms of declaration and scope.</p>
            <p>Let's explore how variables are declared and used in both languages.</p>
            <p>Understanding variable declaration and usage is fundamental for manipulating data within a program.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="declaring_variables">
            <header>Declaring variables</header>
            <p>Variables in JavaScript are typically declared using var, let, or const keywords. These keywords have different scoping rules and immutability characteristics</p>
            <p>Here's an example of variable declaration in JavaScript:</p>
            <code>let greeting = 'Hello, World!';</code>
            <p>Java, on the other hand, uses explicit type declaration. Java requires a specific type to be declared for each variable.</p>
            <code>String message = "Hello, World!";</code>
            <p>Understanding the nuances between these languages is essential for developers looking to leverage their unique capabilities effectively.</p>

        <section class="main-section" id="data_types">
            <header>Data types</header>
            <p>Both JavaScript and Java support various data types to represent different kinds of information. Understanding data types is crucial for effectively managing and manipulating data in programs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Six data types that are primitives:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Boolean. true and false.</li>
                        <li>null. A special keyword denoting a null value. Because JavaScript is case-sensitive, null is not the same as Null, NULL, or any other variant.</li>
                        <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                        <li>String.</li>
                        <li>Number</li>
                        <li>Symbol (new in ECMAScript 2015). A data type whose instances are unique and immutable.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>and Object</li>
            </ul>
        </section>

        <section class="main-section" id="function_declarations">
            <header>Function declarations</header>
            <p>Functions are the building blocks of reusable code in both JavaScript and Java. Let's explore function declaration syntax and usage in both languages. A function definition (also called a function declaration, or function statement) consists of the function keyword, followed by:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The name of the function</li>
                <li>A list of arguments to the function, enclosed in parentheses and separated by commas</li>
                <li>The JavaScript statements that define the function, enclosed in curly brackets, { }.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For example, the following code defines a simple function named square:</p>
            <code>function square(number) { return number * number; }</code>
            <p>The function square takes one argument, called number. The function consists of one statement that says to return the argument of the function (that is, number) multiplied by itself. The return statement specifies the value returned by the function.</p>
            <code>return number * number;</code>
            <p>Primitive parameters (such as a number) are passed to functions by value; the value is passed to the function, but if the function changes the value of the parameter, this change is not reflected globally or in the calling function.</p>
            <p>We can also declare arrow functions as follows:</p>
            <code>const multiply = (a, b) => a * b;</code>
